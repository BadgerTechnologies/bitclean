# bitclean GTK#

This is the GTK# version which will (hopefully) allow bitclean to be run and/or developed on any machine.

bitclean is a map cleanup tool being developed for use by Badger Technologies.

This program imploys several algorithms to automatically detect and remove unwanted clutter from dirty maps for the map cleaning process.

You will need to make sure your IDE references bin/debug/Nplot*

Your IDE needs to reference GTK# as well.
